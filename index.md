title: Getting started with Go
---

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.  It's an open source project,  hosted on a  [GitHub repository](<https://github.com/golang/go>). It's a modern programming language architected to solve engineering problems. Go is loved by many because of some of the advantages it brings along:

- It  is compiled rather than interpreted for the best possible performance
- It allows  running multiple processes concurrently
- It is statically typed 
- It's fast
